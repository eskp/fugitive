INFO
====

fugitive is a blog engine running on top of git using hooks to generate static
html pages and thus having only git as dependency.


INSTALL
=======

Simply run `fugitive --install <dir>`.
This will create the git repos with appropriate hooks and files in <dir>.
If <dir> isn't specified then the current working directory is used.

NOTE: You need to use the same process to install remote repository.


UPDATE
======

Simply run `fugitive --install-hooks <dir>`.
This will only (re)install fugitive hooks scripts.
If <dir> isn't specified then the current working directory is used.


CONFIGURATION
=============

There are three item in the "fugitive" section of the git config:

 - "public-dir" is the path to the directory that will contain the generated
   html files. Defautlt value is ".", the root of the git repository. You
   could set it to "blog" for instance if you already have a static website
   under your git repos.

 - "articles-dir" is the path where fugitive will look for published articles.
   Default value is "fugitive/articles". This path is relative to the root of
   the git repository, must be in it and must not start with ".".

 - "templates-dir" is the path where fugitive will look for templates files.
   Default value is "fugitive/templates". This path is relative to the root of
   the git repository, must be in it and must not start with ".".

NOTE: You must NOT put a trailing '/' at the end of any of those paths.
