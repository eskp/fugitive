<p>
  fugitive is a blog engine running on top of git using hooks to generate
  static html pages and thus having only git as dependency.
</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>
  If you want to build fugitive from the source, clone the git repository:
  <br />
  <code>git clone git://gitorious.org/fugitive/fugitive.git fugitive</code>
  <br />
  Then go in the newly created directory: <code>cd fugitive</code>, and
  run the build script: <code>./build.sh</code>.
  <br />
  This will generate an executable file &quot;fugitive&quot;.
</p>
<h3>Create a blog</h3>
<p>
  If you have the &quot;fugitive&quot; executable file and want to start a new
  blog: Run <code>fugitive --install &lt;dir&gt;</code>.
  <br />
  This will create the git repos with appropriate hooks and files in
  &lt;dir&gt;.
  <br />
  If &lt;dir&gt; isn't specified then the current working directory is used.
</p>
<p class="important">
  Once you have installed your blog you need to set the <em>blog-url</em>
  parameter in your git configuration. See <a href="#config">configuration</a>
  for details.
</p>
<p class="note">
  You need to use the same process to install any remote
  repository where you'd like to push your blog.
</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>
  Run <code>fugitive --install-hooks &lt;dir&gt;</code>.<br />
  This will only (re)install fugitive hooks scripts.<br />
  If &lt;dir&gt; isn't specified then the current working directory is used.
</p>

<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>

<p>
  All this settings are in the &quot;fugitive&quot; section of the git config.
  You can change them with the command <code>git config
  fugitive.<em>parameter</em> <em>value</em></code>, where <em>parameter</em>
  is one of the following:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>blog-url</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the public url of the generated blog. <strong>You need to set
    it</strong> as soon as possible since it's required for the RSS feed (and
    used in the default template's footer).
  </dd>
  <dt>public-dir</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the path to the directory that will contain the generated html
    files. Defautlt value is &quot;.&quot;, the root of the git repository. You
    could set it to &quot;blog&quot; for instance if you already have a static
    website under your git repos.
  </dd>
  <dt>articles-dir</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the path where fugitive will look for published articles. Default
    value is &quot;_articles&quot;. This path is relative to the root of the
    git repository, must be in it and must not start with &quot;.&quot;.
  </dd>
  <dt>templates-dire</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the path where fugitive will look for templates files. Default
    value is &quot;_templates&quot;. This path is relative to the root of the
    git repository, must be in it and must not start with &quot;.&quot;.
  </dd>
  <dt>preproc</dt>
  <dd>
    If you want your article to be preprocessed by an external tool (markdown,
    textile...) you need to set <em>preproc</em> to a command line that will
    read on stdin and write to stdout.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="note">
  You must NOT put a trailing '/' at the end of any of the path.
