fugitive README file

<h2>Info</h2>
<p>
  fugitive is a blog engine running on top of git using hooks to generate
  static html pages and thus having only git as dependency.
</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>
  If you want to build fugitive from the source, clone the git repository:
  <br />
  <code>git clone git://gitorious.org/fugitive/fugitive.git fugitive</code>
  <br />
  Then simply go in the newly created directory: <code>cd fugitive</code>, and
  run the build script: <code>./build.sh</code>.
  <br />
  This will generate an executable file &quot;fugitive&quot;.
</p>
<h3>Create a blog</h3>
<p>
  If you have the &quot;fugitive&quot; executable file and want to start a new
  blog: Run <code>fugitive --install &lt;dir&gt;</code>.
  <br />
  This will create the git repos with appropriate hooks and files in
  &lt;dir&gt;.
  <br />
  If &lt;dir&gt; isn't specified then the current working directory is used.
<p>
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> You need to use the same process to install any remote
  repository where you'd like to push your blog.
</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>
  Simply run <code>fugitive --install-hooks &lt;dir&gt;</code>.<br />
  This will only (re)install fugitive hooks scripts.<br />
  If &lt;dir&gt; isn't specified then the current working directory is used.
</p>

    "public-dir" is the path to the directory that will contain the generated
    html files. Defautlt value is ".", the root of the git repository. You

    under your git repos.
  </li>
  <li>
    "articles-dir" is the path where fugitive will look for published articles.
    Default value is "_articles". This path is relative to the root of the git
    repository, must be in it and must not start with ".".
  </li>

    Default value is "_templates". This path is relative to the root of the git
    repository, must be in it and must not start with ".".

  those paths.
